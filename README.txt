//How to setup and not crash ur PC //

1. Run the HWID Auth.py fist ur will see something like this : 

[ERROR] HWID Not In DataBase
Copy You're HWID
HWID: ********-*****-****-****-********* (it will be a mix of numbers and letters)
[ERROR] Failed To Connect To DataBase

2. Copy the HWID and make ur way to pastebin.com and make an account and verify ur email. Then make a new paste and call it Auth or anything u want it to be called and save the past as unlisted.

3. in the URL tab copy the link and paste it where my pastebin link is.

4. Double check that ur HWID is save by Running HWID Auth.py and if it says "You are Logged in" it was successful!

now u have full acces to the file and any modifercations and allowed as this is open source.
